# **Cracking-Java-Code (CJC) - 2018-2019**
-----------------
> Cracking Java Code is a coding series started by me as I continued to learn code in my  own way. Each step is logged on a daily basis and this repository some day may become an open source knowledge and guide to start off every coder with the basics of the language and slowly to a much deeper level of understanding with the help example code and theoretical explanation.

## **Disclaimer**
-----------------
> The purpose of this repository is to give you an idea and understanding about java code syntax and to guide you if you are confused about what to learn and
> how to learn and what not to learn when coding in java. Repository will be updated whenever I learn new 'stuff' in java. Meanwhile, this repository has the 
> knowledge and context upto my complete understanding of the concept irrespective of any source. What this repository comprises of no textual information from 
> any sources but rather own implications and ideas from gathering and reading many sources. Completing this series means you are code ready and not job ready.

## **Context**
------------------





------------------
### **Object Oriented Programming

### Identifiers and Modifiers
**Modifiers:** 

**Non Access Modifiers**
* static modifier for creating class methods and variables
* final modifier for finalizing the implementations of  classes, methods and variables
* abstract modifier for creating abstract classes and methods
* synchronized and volatile: these are used for threads

**Access Modifiers**
* Default: visible to the package no modifiers are required
* Protected: visible to the package and its sub classes
* Public:  Visible globally
* Private: Visible to the class members


<dl>
	<dt><strong>Identifiers:</strong></dt>
	<dd>Identifiers are the names of variables, methods, classes, packages and interfaces. Unlike literals they are not the things themselves, just ways of referring to them. In the HelloWorld program, HelloWorld , String , args , main and println are identifiers</dd>
